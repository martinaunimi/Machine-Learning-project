# Urban Sound Classification
## Machine learning, statistical learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence
Automatic urban sound classification is a growing area of research with applications in several fields of our everyday life. In this paper, Tensorflow2 will be used in order to train neural networks for the classification of sound events based on audio files from the UrbanSound8K dataset.
Two neural networks architectures for multi-class classification will be implemented: the multilayer perceptron model and the convolutional neural network. Furthermore, several features extraction methodologies implemented in the librosa library will be examined: in particular, the MFCCs and the STFT Chromagram will be chosen. The different results obtained will be presented and will be compared to each other.
